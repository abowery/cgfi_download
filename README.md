Code for the 'DAFNI Open Access Datasets Download Service'


This code downloads the metadata from the DAFNI CLI service, it uses this to populate a database. This enables a basic webservice to query the metadata and allow the downloading of the datasets hosted by the DAFNI service without authentication. This work was done for the CGFI project (July 2024)
